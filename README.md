[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=chriscow&count_private=true)](https://github.com/chriscow/github-readme-stats)Iâ€™ve spent the last 20 years successfully leading engineering and IT teams at a senior level in a compliance-heavy, regulated environment, and have been actively writing software since I was a kid ... like since the early 80's. Itâ€™s my lifeâ€™s work. 

Nearly every person on the Internet over the age of 25 has used something I've written in one way or another. I was an engineer at Microsoft working on Internet Explorer (back when it was actually cool). Iâ€™ve been using C# / .NET since it was an internal tool before Microsoft ever released it (it used to be called â€˜Coolâ€™).  In other companies I wrote and managed the teams that created the largest authoritative DNS system on the planet. Nearly every person on the Internet got where they were going at one point using my software and infrastructure.
