Iâ€™ve been actively writing software since I was a kid ... like since the early 80's. Itâ€™s my lifeâ€™s work. I can still hear my Dad telling me as a kid, "If you spent as much time on your homework as that computer, you might get somewhere."

Lately I'm most interested in working with Go but I've spent most of my years with Python and C#. Iâ€™ve been using C# / .NET since it was an internal tool before Microsoft ever released it (it used to be called â€˜Coolâ€™) although I use it a lot less lately except for my Unity projects.

I bet nearly every person on the Internet over the age of 25 has used something I've written. I was an engineer at Microsoft working on Internet Explorer (back when it was actually cool).  In other companies I wrote and managed the teams that created the largest authoritative DNS system on the planet (at that time). Nearly every person on the Internet got where they were going at one point using my software and infrastructure.
