Iâ€™ve been actively writing software since I was a kid ... like since the early 80's. Itâ€™s my lifeâ€™s work. I can still hear my Dad telling me as a kid, "If you spent as much time on your homework as that computer, you might get somewhere."

I bet nearly every person on the Internet over the age of 25 has used something I've done in one way or another. I was an engineer at Microsoft working on Internet Explorer (back when it was actually cool) and Iâ€™ve been using C# / .NET since it was an internal tool before Microsoft ever released it (it used to be called â€˜Coolâ€™).  In other companies I wrote and managed the teams that created the largest authoritative DNS system on the planet (at that time). Nearly every person on the Internet got where they were going at one point using my software and infrastructure.

### ~~Sucesses~~ Successes are revised mistakes
I actually did mispell that ðŸ‘† when writing the header. After all my years of programning, I still suck. That's why I love engineering: working on puzzles, solving mysteries and endless opportunities to learn something new. I work hard every day to get better, learning from others while trying to pass on what I've learned.
